# OmniEats Application Project

Welcome to the OmniEats Application Project! This collaborative effort brings together the skills and dedication of Antonio, Maria, Neriman, and Gift. OmniEats is more than just a food ordering platform â€“ it's a transformative experience that redefines how you engage with restaurants. In this README, we'll walk you through the architecture, innovative features, thorough testing, captivating user stories, and much more that define the core of OmniEats.

## Project Structure

Our project harmoniously combines frontend and backend excellence. The frontend showcases expertise in HTML, CSS, and jQuery, resulting in an intuitive and engaging user interface. The backend employs the power of Node.js and a robust PostgreSQL database for dynamic logic and seamless data management. The synchronization of these components reflects our unified vision and collaborative spirit.

## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` file using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the `.env` file with your local database information:
   - username: `labber`
   - password: `labber`
   - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Rebuild binaries for Sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset the database: `npm run db:reset` (Note: This will reset data)
6. Run the server: `npm run local`
   - Nodemon is used, so restarting the server is usually unnecessary
7. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Avoid direct edits to `layout.css` since it's auto-generated from `layout.scss`.
- Organize routes into separate resource-based files (e.g., `users.js` and `widgets.js`).
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files.
- Utilize helper functions for SQL queries and data cleanup from the database.
- Use `npm run db:reset` to apply changes to the database schema or seeds. Note that this command will reset existing data.
